# Face-Recognition
It is an open CV based project. 
Build a face recognition system which recognize faces using K Nearest Neighbor classification algorithm. 
Used existing Haar Cascades frontal face detection algorithm to detect the face.
Model can be trained by user itself by providing data(i.e recording their faces and entering their name).Its code can be found in data collection file.
